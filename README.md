# Chill

Chill is an Android application. It performs one task: freezing (and unfreezing) applications. It requires root access, and has been tested on a physical device (running Android 2.3.6).

Frozen applications are prevented from running by the Android operating system. The most common use of freezing is to temporarily disable applications which run background services without having to install and uninstall them constantly.

## Usage

Compile Chill using the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). Install it to your chosen device, and run it from your launcher.

A list of installed applications will be presented; from here, you can disable (and enable) applications.

## Notice

I take no responsibility for any damages which may occur through your use of this application. It was created **solely** as an exercise in Android development.
